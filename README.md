# Let-us-see-the-Art

The program will show the player a word, but each character of the word is shown as ’_’. The player has to guess one character at a time. If the player guesses a correct character of the word, that character at all the places in the word will be displayed. Every time the player guesses wrong, more of a piece of ’character art’ will be chosen and shown. The game is over after 9 incorrect guesses.</br>
The program reads a list of words from a file, from which a random word will be shown to the player. The program then has to show a representation of the word and read the guesses of the player. All correct guessed characters will be shown. The artowrk will not be displayed for correct guesses.
